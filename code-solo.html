    In the robotics team, I am the lead programmer, and I am fluent in the Java and Go programming languages. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Additionally, I play electric bass as well as trumpet. My main electric bass is a Fender Jazz Vibe 60s fretless
    bass, and my secondary one is a Ibanez TMB100. In college, I want to major in Computer Science, as I want to become
    a software engineer. </p>
